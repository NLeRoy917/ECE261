# IUPUI ECE261

![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/NLeRoy917/ECE261_Abdullah)

Code, notes, resources, and other fun things for tutoring the ECE 261 course at IUPUI.

The only reason this repo is public is due to the limitations of the **[repl.it](repl.it/~)** site... and by limitations I mean pay-walls  >:(

Please refer to the IUPUI's guidlines for this course regarding plagiarism and cheating: **You should be writing your own code, except for help provided by the lab instructors, tutors, and instructor. If we discover cheating/plagiarism we reserve the right to assess all possible penalties.**


*Disclaimer: I am formally trained as a bioengineer, not a compouter scientist, so all of this information is stuff I have picked up along the way to getting my engineering degree and self-learning... Please make pull requests if you stumble on this and find any factual errors, poor coding standards, or just mistakes in general.*
